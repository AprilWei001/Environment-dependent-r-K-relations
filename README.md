# Environment-dependent-r-K-relations

There are currently five main figures and three supplementary figures in Wei and Zhang “Environment-dependent pleiotropic effects of mutations on the maximum growth rate r and carrying capacity K of population growth”. This repository is created to provide data (and scripts) for this paper. 

The estimated r and K of each strain in each environment are included in “S1 Data”, a supplementary data file included in the paper. The plain text version of “S1 Data” is also included under this repository as “r_k_strain_indexed.txt”, and an unformatted “.xlsx” file as “R_K_strain_indexed.xlsx”.

Figure 1. The logistic growth fitting result of each strain in each environment is in file “R_K_rsquare.xlsx” under this repository.
Figure 2. Use “r_k_strain_indexed.txt” and “Fig2.m” to recreate this figure.
Figure 3. Use “QTL36_fitting_result.xlsx”, “simulatedQTL_fitting_result_36.xlsx”, and “Fig3.m” to recreate this figure.
Figure 4. Use “SNPQTL36_genotype_all.xlsx”, “R_K_strain_indexed.xlsx” and “Fig4.m” to create this figure.
Figure 5. Use “r_k_strain_indexed.txt” and “Fig5.m” to create this figure.

Fig S1. All numerical values here are included in “S1 Data”.
Fig S2. Use “FigS2.m” to create this figure. 
Fig S3. The data should be directly downloaded from https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?type=supplementary&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002111.s001, and the figure can be recreated by running “analyzeWarringerData.m”.
